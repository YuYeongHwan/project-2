		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Project Initialization and Dependency Setup",
			"complexityScore": 2,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break this task down into three subtasks: 1. Install the required Supabase npm packages (`@supabase/supabase-js`, `@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs`). 2. Create the `.env.local` file, add it to `.gitignore`, and populate it with placeholder environment variables for the Supabase URL and anon key. 3. Create a new utility file at `lib/supabase/client.ts` to initialize and export the Supabase client for use in client components, and another at `lib/supabase/server.ts` for server components and Server Actions.",
			"reasoning": "Codebase analysis shows this is a fresh Next.js project with Shadcn/ui already installed, but no Supabase dependencies. The task is low complexity as it involves running install commands and creating standard configuration files. The existence of Shadcn/ui reduces the original scope of setting up a UI library from scratch."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Design and Implement Supabase Database Schema",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task by creating a separate subtask for defining the schema of each required table. For each subtask, specify the columns, data types, constraints (e.g., NOT NULL), and any foreign key relationships. The tables to create are: `profiles`, `clothing_items`, `recommendations`, `feedback`, and `saved_styles`.",
			"reasoning": "This task is entirely performed within the Supabase dashboard or via migration files and does not touch the existing application code. The complexity is not in the implementation, which is straightforward SQL, but in the database design itself. A mistake in defining relationships or data types here can be costly later, warranting a moderate complexity score."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Implement User Authentication (Sign-up/Sign-in)",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break this task into four subtasks: 1. Create the UI for the sign-up and sign-in pages (e.g., `/login`) using existing Shadcn/ui components. 2. Implement Next.js Server Actions to handle form submissions, calling the Supabase `signUp` and `signInWithPassword` methods. 3. Add a sign-out button to the main layout and connect it to a sign-out server action. 4. Create a `middleware.ts` file to protect application routes and manage user sessions using `@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs`.",
			"reasoning": "Codebase analysis confirms no authentication logic exists. This is a greenfield feature requiring coordination between UI (new pages and components), server-side logic (Server Actions), and Next.js routing (middleware). While Supabase helpers simplify the process, connecting these pieces in the Next.js App Router paradigm gives it a moderate complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Create User Profile Page and Form",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break this task into two subtasks: 1. Create a new protected route at `/profile` that includes the basic page layout and a title. 2. Within the profile page, create a client component for the profile form, using existing Shadcn/ui components (`Input`, `Label`, `Card`) for gender, age, height, weight, and style preferences. This component should also fetch and display existing data for the logged-in user.",
			"reasoning": "The project has no `/profile` page. This task is a standard form-building exercise. Complexity is low because the project already uses Shadcn/ui, providing ready-to-use components like `Input` and `Label`. The task is focused on UI composition and client-side state for the form."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Backend for User Profile Management",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into two subtasks: 1. Create a Next.js Server Action that receives profile form data. This action should validate the data, get the current user's session, and perform an `upsert` operation on the `profiles` table in Supabase. 2. Integrate this Server Action into the profile form component (from Task 4) to handle form submission, including displaying loading states and success/error messages.",
			"reasoning": "The codebase has no API routes or server actions for this functionality. The task involves creating a new server-side function to perform a database write. The logic is a simple 'upsert', but requires careful handling of user authentication, server-side data validation, and error handling, making it slightly more complex than a simple UI task."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Profile Image Upload to Supabase Storage",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break this task into three subtasks: 1. Enhance the profile form UI with a file input component for image selection and a preview area. 2. Implement the client-side logic to upload the selected file to a 'user-photos' bucket in Supabase Storage using the Supabase client library, handling loading and error states. 3. Upon a successful upload, invoke a Server Action to update the `image_url` column in the user's `profiles` table with the public URL of the uploaded file.",
			"reasoning": "File uploads are inherently more complex than simple form submissions. This task requires new UI for file handling, client-side logic to interact with the Supabase Storage API (which is different from the database API), and a subsequent database update to store the URL. Coordinating these steps gives it a medium complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Research and Select External APIs for AI Analysis",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this into a three-step research task: 1. Identify and create a list of at least 3-5 potential third-party APIs for personal color analysis and body shape analysis. 2. For the top 3 candidates, create a comparison table evaluating them on accuracy, pricing, API documentation quality, and rate limits. 3. Write a final summary document recommending one API and providing a justification for the choice.",
			"reasoning": "This is a non-coding research task. It has no impact on the existing codebase. The complexity is low from a development standpoint but requires diligence in evaluation and documentation. The subtasks map to a standard research and decision-making process."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate Weather API",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break this task into two subtasks: 1. Select a weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap), sign up for an API key, and add it to the `.env.local` file. 2. Create a new server-side function in a file like `lib/weather.ts` that takes a location, calls the weather API using the key, and returns a simplified, standardized weather object.",
			"reasoning": "The codebase has no external API integrations. This is a classic, self-contained task of creating a service to wrap a third-party API. The complexity is low, involving a single `fetch` call, JSON parsing, and error handling. It doesn't require complex state management or UI changes."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Implement AI Analysis Service",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break this task into three subtasks: 1. Create a new Next.js API route or Server Action that can be triggered (e.g., by the client after an image upload). 2. Implement the core logic within this function to fetch the user's image URL from Supabase, send it to the selected external AI API, and parse the response. 3. Implement the final step to take the parsed AI results and update the corresponding columns in the user's `profiles` table in Supabase.",
			"reasoning": "This is a moderately complex orchestration task. It involves connecting multiple asynchronous services: our database, the external AI API, and potentially Supabase Storage. It requires robust error handling (e.g., if the external API fails) and data transformation, making it more involved than a simple CRUD operation."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Seed Clothing Items Database",
			"complexityScore": 2,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break this task into two subtasks: 1. Create a JSON file (e.g., in a new `scripts/data` directory) containing an array of at least 50 sample clothing items, with each object matching the `clothing_items` table schema. 2. Write a TypeScript script in `scripts/seed.ts` that reads the JSON file and uses the Supabase client to perform a batch insert into the `clothing_items` table.",
			"reasoning": "This is a one-off, non-application task. The complexity is very low as it involves writing a simple script to read a file and loop through an insert command. The main effort is in collecting the data, not in the programming itself."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 11,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Core Recommendation Engine Logic",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this into four subtasks: 1. Create a server-side function that accepts a user ID and a weather object, and fetches all necessary data: the user's profile and the full catalog of clothing items. 2. Implement the first filtering pass on the clothing items based on the weather object (e.g., filter out warm coats in hot weather). 3. Implement a second filtering pass based on the user's profile attributes (e.g., personal color, style preferences). 4. From the filtered lists, implement the final selection logic to combine one item from each category (top, bottom, etc.) into a coherent outfit and return the result.",
			"reasoning": "This is the most complex piece of business logic in the application. It's not a standard CRUD task but an algorithmic one. It requires designing and implementing a rules engine that synthesizes data from multiple sources (user, weather, catalog). The high complexity score reflects the challenge of creating effective and scalable filtering and selection logic."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 12,
			"taskTitle": "Build Daily Recommendation Display UI",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break this task into three subtasks: 1. On the main page (`app/page.tsx`), add a 'Get Today's Recommendation' button and a container to display the results. 2. Implement the client-side logic to call the recommendation engine's server action on button click and manage the state (loading, error, recommendation data). 3. Create a new `RecommendationCard` component that takes the recommendation data as a prop and renders the full outfit, using existing Shadcn/ui components to display each item's image, name, and other details.",
			"reasoning": "This is a standard client-server UI task. The codebase has no such component. Complexity is moderate because it involves asynchronous data fetching, state management (loading, error, success), and designing a responsive layout to display a collection of items, not just a single piece of data. The use of existing Shadcn/ui components prevents it from being more complex."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 13,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Recommendation Feedback (Like/Dislike)",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break this task into two subtasks: 1. Add 'Like' and 'Dislike' buttons (using Shadcn/ui `Button` with icons from `lucide-react`) to the recommendation display component. 2. Create a Server Action that accepts a recommendation ID and a feedback type ('like' or 'dislike'). This action will insert a new record into the `feedback` table with the current user's ID and the provided data.",
			"reasoning": "This is a small, self-contained feature. The pattern (UI event -> Server Action -> DB insert) is standard. The codebase has `Button` components available. The complexity is low as it requires a simple UI addition and a straightforward backend function to perform a single database write."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 14,
			"taskTitle": "Implement 'Save Style' Functionality",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into four subtasks: 1. Add a 'Save Style' button to the recommendation display UI. 2. Create a Server Action to save the outfit, which will create a new entry in the `saved_styles` table. 3. Create a new page at the route `/saved-styles`. 4. On this new page, implement the logic to fetch all saved styles for the current user (potentially requiring a join with `clothing_items`) and display them in a gallery format.",
			"reasoning": "This task is more complex than feedback because it involves both a 'write' action and a completely new 'read' feature with its own page. It requires creating a new route, fetching and displaying a list of complex objects (outfits), and potentially handling more complex database queries (e.g., joins), giving it a medium complexity score."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 15,
			"taskTitle": "Set up n8n for Workflow Automation",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break this task into three subtasks: 1. Deploy a new n8n instance (either on n8n Cloud or locally via Docker). 2. In the Supabase dashboard, configure a database webhook that triggers on new insertions into the `auth.users` table. 3. In n8n, create a new workflow with a Webhook node to receive the trigger from Supabase, and connect it to a node that sends a welcome email.",
			"reasoning": "This task is entirely external to the Next.js codebase. The complexity is not in application coding but in DevOps and third-party service integration. It requires deploying and configuring n8n, and correctly setting up a webhook in Supabase to trigger a workflow. This can be moderately complex for someone unfamiliar with these specific tools."
